=== REGION GROWING ALGORITHM ===

algorithm region-growing is
    input: i by j by l array of grayscale values G,
           seed location S in RÂ³,
           threshold value T
    output: i by j array containing grayscale values > threshold

    let L = region
    choose arbitrary S

    for each adjacent voxel V to S do
        if G > T
            add V to L

    while there are unchecked pixels remaining do
        for each voxel in L
            for each adjacent voxel V
                if V is in L
                    continue
                if G > T
                    add to L
