=== REGION GROWING ALGORITHM ===

Inputs: i by j by l array of grayscale values G,
       seed location S in RÂ³,
       threshold value T
Output: Region list R

Initialize: Region list R <- 0
            Available points list A <- {All voxels in the CT image}

Algorithm:

    while A is not empty do:

        Current region R_c <- 0
        Current Seed S_c <- 0
        R_c <- S
        S_c <-S
        A <- A \ S (remove S from A)

        for seed in S_c do:
            Find set of nearest neighbours B_c of S_c

            for nb in B_c do
                if A contains nb and nb_grayValue > T
                    Add nb to R_c
                    Add nb to S_c
                    A <- A \ nb (remove nb from A)
                end if
            end for
        end for

        Add R_c to R

    end while

    return R
